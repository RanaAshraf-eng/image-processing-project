# Image Classification Project

This project demonstrates a basic image classification pipeline using Python and popular deep learning libraries. The model is trained to classify different types of images using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

## Project Structure

- `Project_Image.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all code steps including data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## The notebook shows:

Training and validation accuracy/loss curves.

Confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.

Sample predictions on test images.

## Notes
Make sure your dataset is in the correct path before running the notebook.

Modify the number of classes and labels based on your dataset.
