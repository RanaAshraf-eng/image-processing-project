# Image Classification Project

This project demonstrates a basic image classification pipeline using Python and popular deep learning libraries. The model is trained to classify different types of images using a convolutional neural network (CNN).

## Project Structure

- `Project_Image.ipynb`: The main notebook containing all code steps including data loading, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and visualization.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Open Project_Image.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.

Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (see below).

Run the notebook cells sequentially to train and evaluate the model.

Dependencies
Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

TensorFlow / Keras

Scikit-learn

OpenCV (optional, if used for image manipulation)

You can install them using:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn opencv-python
Output
The notebook shows:

Training and validation accuracy/loss curves.

Confusion matrix to evaluate model performance.

Sample predictions on test images.

Notes
Make sure your dataset is in the correct path before running the notebook.

Modify the number of classes and labels based on your dataset.
